"""Chip strategy advisor: personalized suggestions for whether it's worth
playing Bench Boost, Triple Captain, Free Hit, or Wildcard, based on the
manager's actual squad, current form, and upcoming fixtures — not just
generic blank/double-gameweek detection.

Wildcard and Free Hit both let a manager rebuild toward an "optimal" squad
at the same budget; the difference is permanence. This module compares the
manager's current squad against an optimally assembled one (via
optimizer.optimize_squad) at two horizons: just the next gameweek, and
averaged over a longer lookahead. A gap that's only there for the next
gameweek (e.g. a one-off blank) points to Free Hit; a gap that persists
over the longer horizon points to Wildcard instead, since only Wildcard's
change carries forward.
