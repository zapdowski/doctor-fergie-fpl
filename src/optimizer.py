    FPL's own 'form' field is just a recent-points average that collapses
    to the same number as points-per-game and total points (there's only
    been one or two gameweeks to average over).

    Each stat is weighted by FPL's own points-per-event values, which
    differ by position (e.g. a defender's clean sheet is worth 4pts, a
    forward's is worth 0) — so a defender racking up clean sheets and a
    forward racking up expected goals both surface, appropriately.

    Clean-sheet likelihood is approximated as 1 - expected_goals_conceded

    probability model. Players under min_minutes get 0: with so few

    most expensive still-improving option wins, with score only breaking
    ties among similarly-priced candidates. Paired with a transfer-count
    search that maximizes net score (see the "Maximize potential score"
    caller-side option — worth using here too, since a set of individually
    improving transfers can still net negative once -4 hits are counted),
    this converges on the highest score reachable while leaning toward
    full budget use.

    This is a greedy heuristic, not a global optimum over combinations of
    simultaneous transfers — good enough for "which single swaps help most"
    without a combinatorial search.
