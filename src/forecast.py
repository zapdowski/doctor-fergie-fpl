"""Team-level expected-goals model, fit from this season's actual match
results — the real-forecasting counterpart to the hand-picked FDR
multiplier table in fixtures.py.

Each team gets a fitted attack strength (expected goals scored against a
league-average defence at a neutral venue) and defence strength (expected
goals conceded against a league-average attack), plus a single league-wide
home-advantage factor. A fixture's expected goals for each side are then:

    expected_goals(home=i, away=j) = attack[i] * defence[j] * home_advantage
    expected_goals(away=j, home=i) = attack[j] * defence[i]

Fit via iterative proportional fitting — coordinate-ascent maximum
likelihood for this independent-Poisson model, the same well-established
approach behind most public football-goals models (minus Dixon-Coles' own
low-score correlation correction, which isn't worth the added complexity
here). The equations themselves are self-normalizing: because attack/
defence are anchored to real goal totals (not just relative comparisons),
there's no separate scale-identifiability step needed.

From expected goals, two real (if simplified) forecasts fall out:
  - attacking_multiplier: how much a specific fixture's expected goals for
    a team deviate from that team's own season-average attack — replaces
    the FDR lookup table for MID/FWD scoring.
  - defensive_multiplier: how much a specific fixture's clean-sheet
    probability (via the Poisson P(opponent scores 0) formula) deviates
    from that team's own season-average clean-sheet probability — replaces
    the FDR lookup table for GKP/DEF scoring.

Every caller must be ready for fit_team_strengths to return (None, None,
None): with too few finished matches and no usable prior (see below),
there's nothing meaningful to fit, and callers should fall back to the
FDR-based proxy instead.

When this season's own results are thin, fit_team_strengths can also lean
on a prior — FPL's own strength_attack_home/away and
strength_defence_home/away ratings (bootstrap-static's per-team fields,
an Elo-like scale FPL sets partly from past performance), converted to a
relative attack/defence multiplier via team_priors_from_strength_ratings.
Early on, a team's fitted strength is shrunk toward this prior instead of
a flat league average; as more of the current season accumulates, the
prior's influence fades out in favour of what's actually happened this
season. When FPL hasn't populated those fields for this account (they
come back all zero), there's no usable signal there and everything falls
back to the flat-average behaviour as before.
